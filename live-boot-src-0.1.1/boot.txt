== Booting antiX
{top}

Assuming a gloss:boot_loader[boot loader] (such as Grub) is installed and
configured correctly then just three files are needed in order to boot {antix}
Live Media (liveCD, LiveUSB, etc):

===== +vmlinuz+

A compressed Linux kernel.

===== +initrd.gz+
A small compressed file system that contains the gloss:linuxrc  bootstrap
script and a limited toolkit usually supplied by
link:http://www.busybox.net/[BusyBox].

===== +linuxfs+
A complete Linux filesystem in a single compressed gloss:squashfs[squashfs
file].  Traditionally this file was located at +/antiX/antiX+ in the
gloss:ISO_image[ISO file.]  The name has been changed to linuxfs so it is now
found at +/antiX/linuxfs+.  The official {antix} ISO files will contain a
symlink at +/antiX/antiX+ that links to the linuxfs file. 


The boot loader handles finding the first two files so usually most of the pain
and aggravation in the past has involved the simple task of finding the
linuxfs file.  The previous linuxrc script would scan through all possible
devices and partitions, mounting each one and looking for a file at
+/antiX/antiX+.  Unfortunately, it sometimes takes a few extra seconds for a
USB stick to show up as a device so people were often adding an extra delay
with cheat:rootdelay=10: to give time for a LiveUSB device to settle.  In
addition, several extra ad hoc delays were embedded in the linuxrc script to
try to address the settling problem.  Booting was slower for everyone and was
often unreliable.

== What's New
{top}

The new script handles this all differently.  First, we have a
cheat:bootlabel: option that allows you to boot off of a specifically labeled
partition.  This will make LiveUSB booting more reliable across different
machines because the device name of a USB stick will changes depending on the
number and type of internal drivers but the label stays the same.  Next,
regardless of how the boot device is specified (or if we have to scan for it),
if we fail to find the linuxfs file the first time then we try cheat:retry:
more times, pausing one second between tries.  The user doesn't have to guess
how large a cheat:rootdelay: to use and they don't have to wait watching a
blank screen hoping for something to happen.

We also scan SCSI hard drives in reverse alphabetical order.  Since USB
devices tend to have a higher letters (+/dev/sdb+ is higher than +/dev/sda+)
than internal drives, we usually find USB sticks faster when we are
scanning and we will needlessly mount partitions on internal drives less
often.


[[boot-options]]
== Basic Booting Boot Options
{top}

All of the boot* options: cheat:bootdev:, cheat:bootdir:, cheat:bootlabel:,
and cheat:bootuuid: can be abbreviated by replacing "boot" with "b".  So
cheat:bdev:, cheat:bdir:, cheat:blabel:, and cheat:buuid: are all valid
parameters.  In addition, cheat:blabel: can be further abbreviated to
cheat:blab:.

Basic booting involves specifying the boot device and specifying the name
of the linuxfs file and the directory it is in.

=== Specify the boot device
{top}

These parameters allow you to specify which device holds the squashfs file by
device name, device label, or device UUID.  If none of these options are
specified then we revert to scanning all possible block devices.

[[bootdev]]
==== cheat:bootdev:
the name of the device that holds the linuxfs file.  This is similar to the
old cheat:fromhd=: parameter except this version allows you to omit the
leading "/dev/" when specifying a device so cheat:bootdev=sdb1: does the same
thing as cheat:bootdev=/dev/sdb1:.  Abbreviation: cheat:blab=sdb1:.

[[bootlabel]]
==== cheat:bootlabel:
the label of the device that holds the linuxfs file.  In other words
cheat:bootlabel=LiveUSB: does what cheat:fromhd=LABEL=LiveUSB: was expected to
do (but didn't).  Abbreviations: cheat:blabel:, cheat:blab:.

[[bootuuid]]
==== cheat:bootuuid:
the UUID of the device that holds the linuxfs file  Abbreviation:
cheat:buuid.


=== The name and location of the linuxfs file
{top}

[[bootdir]]
==== cheat:bootdir:
The directory that holds the linuxfs file.  The default is +antiX+ which is
fine for a LiveCD or LiveDVD but is inadequate for LiveUSBs and LiveHDs.  The
problem is that there can easily be more than one /antiX/antiX file or more
than one /antiX/linuxfs file if someone has done any frugal installs in the
past.  The device scanning stops at the first device that has the desired
directory/file even if it is the wrong one.  If we simply include the antiX
version number in the cheat:bootdir: for LiveUSBs and LiveHDs then a number of
potential problems are neatly avoided.  The cheat:image_dir: option is still
available.  It does the same things as bootdir but is deprecated.

[[sqname]]
==== cheat:sqname:
the name of the linuxfs file.  The default is now +linuxfs+.  It used to be
+antiX+.  There is usually no need to change this name but you are free to do
so if you want.   The cheat:image_name: option is still available.  It does
the same things as cheat:sqname: but is deprecated.


[[sqext]]
==== cheat:sqext:
the extension of the linuxfs file This is an extension that is tacked onto
the end of the linuxfs name.  so cheat:sqext=xx: does the same thing as
cheat:sqname=linuxfs.xx:. {note} this option (as well as any extension on the
linuxfs file name) is incompatible with remastering on filesystems that are
restricted to 8.3 file names.


=== Try, Try Again
{top}

There are now four different places you can add delays to the boot process.
All of them default to zero except cheat:retry:.  Usually cheat:retry: is the
only one that is needed.  Occasionally, cheat:rootdelay: may be needed but
cheat:delay: and cheat:wait: should almost never be needed.

[[retry]]
==== cheat:retry:
Number of times to retry mounting the boot device, waiting one second between
tries.  This replaces cheat:rootdelay: for many (but not all) cases.  Usually,
if the boot device is not found after the default number of retries, there is
a configuration problem and no amount of retries will fix it. Default: 9.

[[rootdelay]]
==== cheat:rootdelay:
Delay this many seconds before looking for the +initrd.gz+ file.  If the
welcome:[] message is not seen, then try using cheat:rootdelay=10: or
cheat:rootdelay=20:.  If the welcome message is seen then there is no need for
a cheat:rootdelay:.  

[[delay]]
==== cheat:delay:
Wait this many seconds before starting to look for the +linuxfs+ file.  This
should seldom, if ever, be needed. Usually, it is better (and faster) to rely
on cheat:retry: instead.

[[wait]]
==== cheat:wait:
Wait this many seconds after the bootstrap is complete before starting init.
