== Glossary of Terms

These are some technical terms used throughout this guide.

[[antiX]]
==== antiX
Pronounced like the word _antics_, which means playful behavior.  {antix} is a
fast, lightweight and easy to install Linux live CD distribution based on
Debian Testing for Intel-AMD x86 compatible system.

[[AUFS]]
====  AUFS
Another Union File System.  It combines a read-only file system (often
linuxfs) with a read-write file system (often tmpfs) so that the bulk
of the storage is (usually) taken care of by the read-only system while
all changes are stored in the read-write system.
wiki:aufs

[[boot_loader]]
==== boot loader 
A small program that runs right after the power-on self test
(POST) that then loads a boot strap program or the operating system you want
to run.  Common boot loaders include: Grub, Grub2, Lilo, and isolinux.  Boot
loaders usually show you a menu that lets you decide what system to boot into
or what boot options to use.

[[boot_partition]]
==== boot partition 
This is normally the partition that holds the linuxfs file when booting
live media.  When booting cheat:fromiso: it is the partition that contains
the ISO file.

[[BusyBox]]
==== BusyBox
From the link:http://www.busybox.net/about.html[BusyBox website]: BusyBox
combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small
executable ...  BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.

BusyBox is 
[[byte]]
==== byte
A small unit of computer storage.  One byte is roughly the amount of memory
used to store one ASCII character or punctuation mark so 1,000 bytes could
hold roughly 1,000 characters.  wiki:byte

[[frugal_install]]
==== frugal install
A frugal install is the same thing as creating a LiveUSB on an internal hard
drive.  Like a LiveCD and a LiveUSB, the entire file system is stored in a
linuxfs file.  This takes up much less disk space than a normal install which
is why it is called "frugal".  

[[gigabyte]]
==== gigabyte
One gigabyte is a billion bytes (1,000,000,000 bytes). wiki:Gigabyte

[[disk_label]]
==== label, disk
Hard drives, partitions, and removable discs (cds, dvds, and blurays) can all
have an optional digital label. This is not an adhesive label!  Often it is
limited to a handful of characters.  It can very convenient but no effort is
made to ensure labels are unique.

[[initrd]]
==== initrd
Stands for "initial ram disk".  It is an optional feature when booting Linux.
It is a small file system that get mounted in RAM and it provides a very
limited environment for paving the way for the full Linux system.  It is
required if the main root file system requires drivers to be loaded before
it can be accessed.  It is more often used for LiveCDs (and LiveUSBs) which
need extra preparation in order to mount a linuxfs and tmpfs and use
them to create an aufs which is used as the root file system.  The program
that does this work is called linuxrc. wiki:initrd

[[ISO_image]]
==== ISO image file
An ISO image (also called an "ISO file" or "iso file") is a single file that
contains all the information in the file system on a data CD or a data DVD.
The filename extension is ++.iso++ by convention.  These files are usually
used to create a data CD or a data DVD. They can also be mounted directly as a
read-only filesystem:

--------
# mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro some file.iso /mnt/iso
--------
wiki:ISO+Image

[[linuxrc]]
==== linuxrc
When an initrd file is used, this is the first program run in Linux.  For then
antiX LiveCD/USB, this file sets up the AUFS, which makes it appear that Linux
has a real read-write file system over two times larger than the space used
on the CD or USB.

[[LiveCD]]
==== LiveCD 
A LiveCD is a bootable CD that contains a fully functional operating system,
often with a graphic desktop environment.  Uses include:

  * "test drive" a new operating system or distribution
  * Install a new operating system or distribution
  * As a rescue "escape hatch" to fix a broken or unbootable system.

Before the advent of LiveCDs people would have to go through an often lengthy
install procedure before they would be able to try using Linux.  Now, almost
every Linux distribution offers a LiveCD.

[[LiveUSB]]
==== LiveUSB
A LiveUSB is like a LiveCD.  It contains the entire {antix} GNU/Linux
operating system.  It has several advantages or LiveCDs.  See the
link:live_usb.html[LiveUSB page] for more details. wiki:Live+USB

[[megabyte]]
==== megabyte
One megabyte is one million bytes (1,000,000 bytes).
wiki:megabyte

[[RAM]]
==== RAM
Random access memory.  The main system memory in a computer.  It is faster
than hard drives, cds/dvds, and USB flash sticks.  On newer system the amount
of RAM is given in Gigabytes.  On older systems it is usually given in
hundreds for Megabytes. wiki:Random-access+memory

[[remaster]]
==== remaster
Ramastering involves making a new linuxfs file that is a clone of your
current system after it has been modified, usually by adding or deleting
packages or by changing settings.

[[linuxfs]]
==== linuxfs
Linuxfs stands for "(squashed) linux file system".  It is an entire file system
packed into one file and highly compressed.  This is the magic that makes
it possible to store an entire GNU/Linux system on a CDROM.  The downside
of linuxfs is that it is read-only.  You can create a new linuxfs file
but this involves re-compressing the entire file system which consumes time
and resources.  This is process is called remastering. wiki:SquashFS

[[tmpfs]] 
==== tmpfs
A filesystem that is created in RAM.  It is very fast but it consumes RAM that
could be used for other things and it is only temporary.  It is similar to a
ramdisk but there are some technical differences.  wiki:tmpfs 

[[UUID]]
==== UUID
Universally unique identifier.  A 16-byte number usually expressed as 32
hexadecimal digits.  It is used to uniquely identify disk drives and
partitions. wiki:UUID
