== Audience

The intended audience for this guide includes:

[[audience]]
[compact]
* People who write scripts for frugal installs and LiveUSBs
* People who will write tools for user to access persistence and live-remastering
* Developers who want to use the new {antix} linuxrc with other distributions
* Adventurous and/or curious beta-testers

This is meant to be the definitive guide to all the features and options in
the new linuxrc bootstrap script.  It probably contains way too much
information for most end-users, especially newcomers.  Ideally, this guide
will be augmented with information for end users, or a second guide will be
created that is specifically designed for end users.


== What's New?

The linuxrc bootstrap script (that lives inside the +initrd.gz+ file) was
almost totally rewritten.  We now use a non-ancient version of gloss:BusyBox
(which, combined with more modern Linux kernels) gives us access to new and
better tools.  The Knoppix linuxrc script provided great inspiration for a lot
of this.

Some of the more prominent new features include:

[[whats-new]]

==== Faster, more robust booting

Previously the cheat:rootdelay: option was used and suggested as a fix for when
linuxrc is unable to find the squashfs program and the user is dropped to a
limited shell.  With the new linuxrc the rootdelay option should only be needed
if the: welcome:[] message does not appear.   In addition, you can now specify
the boot partition by disk-label or by disk-UUID.  There should be fewer
failures to boot Live Media and when a boot does fail, the steps to fix it
should be easy and straightforward.


==== Better and faster root persistence

Root and home persistence files can now reside on the boot device, the same
device that holds the linuxfs file.  This means you can create a full featured
LiveUSB (or LiveHD) using only one partition even with persistence and
live-remastering.  We can also scan all read-write devices for persistence
files which makes it easy to add persistence to a liveCD as long as there is
some read-write partition available to hold the persistence file(s).

==== Integrated md5 checking

If the Live Media creator (person or program) adds .md5 files in the same
directory as the linuxfs file or the same directory as the .iso file (in
fromiso mode) then if the link:debug.html#check[cheat:check:] boot parameter
is given, every file that has a matching .md5 file will be checked and the
boot will be interrupted if any check fails. 

==== Live remastering

Remastering involves (perhaps among other things) the creation of a new
linuxfs file that reflects change that have been made to the system (usually
the addition or deletion of packages).  We can now offer users "one click"
live remastering (for LiveUSBs and LiveHDs) that will create a new linuxfs
file at the touch of a button and automatically use that linuxfs file on the
next reboot.  The user will always have the option to rollback the change
even if the new linuxfs file is corrupted and fails to boot.

==== Ejecting LiveCD

And, of course, we also fixed the problem with ejecting the LiveCD.
