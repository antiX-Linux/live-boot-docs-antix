When you install {antix} on a computer, you get a chance to set things
up exactly how you want them using the {antix} Control Center or by
simply editing particular files.  Whatever changes you make are
retained on the file system and are there the next time you boot.
With a LiveCD you would have to make the same changes every time you
boot so we've provided some boot options to make personalizing the
LiveCD a little easier.

Much more powerful personalization is available through Persistence
and/or Remastering but these require that use use a read-write device,
like a USB stick.  If you are only using a LiveCD or LiveDVD then some
of the options below could be useful.

[[desktop]]
==== cheat:desktop:
Set the default desktop manager.  Normally only fluxbox, jwm, icewm, dwm and wmii come
pre-installed.  You would have to install other desktops in before using them
as the desktop option is useful.  Nonetheless, the choices are:

[grid="none", id="desktop"]
|======
|cheat:desktop=dwm:                |cheat:desktop=kde:            
|cheat:desktop=fluxbox:            |cheat:desktop=lxde:           
|cheat:desktop=fvwm-crystal:       |cheat:desktop=openbox:        
|cheat:desktop=gnome:              |cheat:desktop=wmii:           
|cheat:desktop=icewm:              |cheat:desktop=xfce: 
|cheat:desktop=jwm:                |cheat:desktop=i3:         
|======

[[dpi]]
==== cheat:dpi:
Set display resolution (in X-windows).  This number is supposed to correspond
to "dots per inch".  A higher number makes the text larger and a smaller
number makes it smaller. Think of it as "font size".  The default value is 96
and the number usually ranges between 90 and 130. Example cheat:dpi=120:

[[drvr]]
==== cheat:drvr:
Set the video driver to used.

[[lang]]
==== cheat:lang:
Set the language, the time-zone, and the keyboard layout.   Choices are:

[grid="none",id="lang"]
|======
| cheat:lang=ar: Arabic            | cheat:lang=fa: Iranian     | cheat:lang=mk: Macedonian
| cheat:lang=au: Australia         | cheat:lang=fi: Finnish     | cheat:lang=no: Norwegian

| cheat:lang=ch: Swiss-German      | cheat:lang=hu: Hungarian   | cheat:lang=sl: Slovene

| cheat:lang=et: Estonian          | cheat:lang=lt: Lithuanian  | cheat:lang=uk: GB-English
| cheat:lang=eu: Basque            | cheat:lang=lv: Latvian     | cheat:lang=us: US-English
|======

[[kbd]]
==== cheat:kbd:
Set keyboard layout

[[kbopt]]
==== cheat:kbopt:
Set keyboard options


[[kbdvar]]
==== cheat:kbdvar:
Set keyboard variant

[[noRox]]
==== cheat:noRox:
disable Rox desktop with some icons

[[tz]]
==== cheat:tz:
Set the timezone

[[vga]]
==== cheat:vga:
Sets the resolution of the virtual (text) consoles.  This is almost all of the
text you see before X-windows starts (and you see a graphical desktop).   Some
common values are:

[options="header",grid="none",id="vga"]
|=======
| ptab:[Decimal] | ptab:[Hex] | ptab:[Size]| ptab:[Resolution (bits)]
| cheat:vga=771: | cheat:vga=0x303: | 800x600   |  8
| cheat:vga=788: | cheat:vga=0x314: | 800x600   | 16
| cheat:vga=789: | cheat:vga=0x315: | 800x600   | 24
| cheat:vga=773: | cheat:vga=0x305: | 1024x768  |  8
| cheat:vga=791: | cheat:vga=0x317: | 1024x768  | 16
| cheat:vga=792: | cheat:vga=0x318: | 1024x768  | 24
| cheat:vga=775: | cheat:vga=0x307: | 1280x1024 |  8
| cheat:vga=794: | cheat:vga=0x31A: | 1280x1024 | 16
| cheat:vga=795: | cheat:vga=0x31B: | 1280x1024 | 24
|=======

Examples are shown in both decimal and hex.  (+0x31B+ is the hex representation
of +795+ decimal).  This is because if you have an odd shaped screen or a
small screen like on a NetBook, the common vga values might not work.  In this
case use cheat:vga=ask: and you will be shown a list of valid vga settings. If
you only need to boot once (ha ha) just select the letter associated with the
size and resolution you want then hit <enter>.  If you might want to boot more
than once (very likely) then write down the code that follows the letter on
a piece of paper.  These codes are in hex so to get them to work in the boot
menu, you need to put "0x" (zero ex) in front like in the second column in
the table above. ({sigh})
