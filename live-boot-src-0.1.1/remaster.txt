== Live Remastering
{top}

The primary purpose of live remastering is to make it as safe, easy, and
convenient as possible for users to make their own customized version of
antiX. The idea is that you use a LiveUSB or a LiveHD (a frugal install to a
hard drive partition) as the development and testing environment.  Add or
subtract packages and then when you are ready to remaster, use use a simple
remaster script or GUI to do the remaster and then reboot.  If something goes
horribly wrong, simply reboot again with the cheat:rollback: option and you
will boot into the previous environment.

If you are using a LiveUSB then the LiveUSB is your target system.  You
can use it to install your customized version of {antix} on other systems.
If you are using a LiveHD then you will need to create a LiveUSB or
a LiveCD from the LiveHD in order to install elsewhere.

[NOTE]
.Note for Developers
=====================================
There is a need for easy GUI programs to do the live remastering
and to create a LiveCD image from a remastered LiveHD/USB.
=====================================

=== System Requirements
{top}

There are three simple and straightforward system requirements that
are needed to perform live remastering:

* The boot device must be writable
* The boot device must have enough free space to create a new linuxfs file
* The development system must have been created using a "frugal install",
not a fromiso install

In other words, the development system must be booted using a linuxfs file
that is on a writable device that has enough free space to create a new
linuxfs file.

== How it Works
{top}

In order to perform a live remaster, you just need to create the new linuxfs
file in the same directory as the existing linuxfs file with the ".new"
extension added.  On the next boot, before the linuxfs file is mounted, the
following commands are (in essence) performed in the directory containing
the linuxfs file:

----------
# mv linuxfs linuxfs.old
# mv linuxfs.new linuxfs
----------

If the new linuxfs file makes the system unbootable then the cheat:rollback:
boot code should be used.  It can either be added manually by the user or
their can be another Grub menu entry that contains the cheat:rollback: option.
In this case the following two commands are (in essence) performed in the
directory containing the linuxfs file:

----------
# mv linuxfs linuxfs.bad
# mv linuxfs.old linuxfs
----------

This reverse the previous actions except the file that was originally called
+linuxfs.new+ is now called +linuxfs.bad+.  If you use the cheat:sqname: or
cheat:sqext: options to change the name of the linuxfs file then these names
are used instead of +linuxfs+.  For example if you boot with cheat:sqext=e16:
then we look for a file called +linuxfs.e16.new+ etc.

=== Remastering Plus Persistence
{top}

A persistent home or a persistent can useful if you are doing remastering.
A persistent home is a handy place to hold your development environment if
you don't want that environment to end up in your remaster.  A persistent
root is a handy way to save changes between reboots without having to go
to the bother of doing a full remaster.  In a mountain climbing analogy, you
can think of the persistent root as a piton (or a
wiki:Spring-loaded_camming_device[spring loaded camming device]) while
remastering is setting up a new campsite or bivouac.

[[boot-options]]
== Live Remaster Boot Options
{top}

There are only two live remaster boot option because live remastering is
almost entirely handled by a script or GUI.  The only two option are to
prevent live remastering and to rollback live remastering in case something
goes horribly wrong.

[[noremaster]]
==== cheat:noremaster:
don't remaster even when a linuxfs.new file is found

[[rollback]]
==== cheat:rollback:
return to previous version after a failed remaster

== Details for Developers
{top}

At its core, live remastering can be done with a single, simple command:

--------------------
# mklinuxfs /aufs linuxfs.new -e tmp var/tmp var/log
--------------------

Almost all of the work is in the details of using the right linuxfs file in
the right directory on the right device, making sure that device is mounted
and is writable, and finally, making sure there is enough free space on the
device to create the new linuxfs files.

=== The Devil's in the Details
{top}

To make writing live remaster programs as easy as possible, the linuxrc
script generates a +remaster.conf+ file in the +/live-config+ directory
whenever remastering is possible.  This usually means that the boot device
is writable and we didn't boot cheat:fromiso:.  In addition, this file
contains all the details you need to do a live remaster.  Here is an example:

.Example +/live-config/remaster.conf+ file
----------------------
BOOT_MP="/boot-dev"
BOOT_DEV="/dev/sdb2"
SQFILE_DIR="/boot-dev/antiX-12"
SQFILE_FULL="/boot-dev/antiX-12/linuxfs"
SQFILE_NAME="linuxfs"

AUFS_MP="/aufs"
AUFS_RAM_MP="/aufs-ram"

DID_REMASTER=""
DID_ROLLBACK=""
----------------------

Here is a bare-bones shell script to do remastering.  It is
not intended to be used (although it should work), it is meant
as a simple example to demonstrate the required steps, namely:

* read config file or exit if file does not exit
* mount the boot device unless it is already mounted
* remount it read-write if it is not already
* create the new linuxfs file

In practice, more error checking should be performed, more
verbose output should be available and devices that were
mounted should be unmounted, etc.  Programs should probably
ask if the user wants to reboot after the new linuxfs file
was created.

---------------------
#!/bin/bash

conf_file=/live-config/remaster.conf

#--- Read variables from conf_file
[-f $conf_file ] || exit
source $conf_file

#--- Mount device holding linuxfs if needed
mountpoint -q $BOOT_MP || mount $BOOT_DEV $BOOT_MP

#--- remount read-write if needed
mnt_opts=$(grep "^$BOOT_DEV " /proc/mounts | cut -d" " -f4)
case ",$mnt_opts," in
    ,rw,) ;;
       *) mount -o remount,rw $BOOT_MP;;
esac

#--- create the new linuxfs file
mklinuxfs $AUFS_MP $SQFILE_FULL.new -e tmp var/tmp var/log
---------------------

=== Remastering Plus Persistence Redux
{top}

// What follows is not yet implemented.

There is a potential problem when combining remastering with root persistence:
the +rootfs+ needs to be cleared when a remastered linuxfs is used and
if the linuxfs is rolled back then the +rootfs+ file system needs to
be restored.  Therefore, if root persistence is enabled when a linuxfs
remastering takes place then we also:

--------------------
# mv rootfs rootfs.old
# mv rootfs.new rootfs
--------------------

If no +rootfs.new+ file exists, then we make an empty file called +rootfs+.
Likewise, if root persistence is enabled when a rollback happens then we:

--------------------
# mv rootfs rootfs.old
# mv rootfs.old rootfs
--------------------

[NOTE]
.Note for Developers
=====================================
If persist root is enabled when you make a +linuxfs.new+ for remastering
then you should also make a +rootfs.new+ containing an empty file system.
This will ensure root persistence continuity.
=====================================


=== Rolling Back and Version Management
{top}

The linuxrc script offers crude emergency rollback option but that doesn't
mean the remastering script can't do rollbacks as well.  It's best to think
of the remaster script as being in control and the linuxrc script offering
a service: to replace the +linuxfs+ file with +linuxfs.new+.  If the linuxrc
script has just performed a remaster or a rollback, this will be reported in
the  +/live-config/remaster.conf+ file.  But that is not 100% reliable since
it is possible that another reboot as occurred before the remaster script has
been run.  What is reliable (or at least much more reliable) is the existence
of the files: +linuxfs.old+ or +linuxfs.bad+.

Generally, a full-featured live-remaster program will use the existence of one
of these files as an indication of either a successful remaster or a rollback.
The script should then "do something" with these files so that it does not
keep thinking a remaster or rollback just occurred.

=== Symlinks can Help
{top}

If a user performs several remasters with or without rollbacks, it will be
very easy to lose track of which version is which.  An easy way around this
problem is to use symlinks for all the linuxfs files, possibly including
the first.  When creating a new LiveUSB, you can name the linuxfs file
+linuxfs.00+ and create a +linuxfs+ symlink that points to it:

--------------------
    linuxfs --> linuxfs.00
--------------------

When it is time to do the first remaster, the new linuxfs file can be
called +linuxfs.01+ with a symlink pointing to it called +linuxfs.new+:

--------------------
   linuxfs.new --> linuxfs.01
--------------------

You can easily tell which version of linuxfs is being used by looking at
the extension of the file the +linuxfs+ symlink points to.  For example:

--------------------
$  basename $(readlink -f $SQFILE_FULL) | sed 's/.*\.\([0-9]\+\)$/\1/' 
--------------------

=== Interactions with Persistent Root
{top}

=== Estimating the Size of a New Linuxfs File
{top}

Since making a new linuxfs file can consume time and resources it is
important to not start the process when we know there is not enough room on
the device to complete it. In other words, we need to estimate how much the
file system will get compressed.  If past performance is indicative of future
results then we can look at the compression ratios for the linuxfs files
distribution in the standard {antix} ISO files:

[options="header", grid="none", cols=">,^,^,^", id="sqfs"]
|==========
| ptab:[antiX System] | ptab:[Linuxfs Size] | ptab:[Actual Size] | ptab:[Ratio]
| 12 core | 108M | 286M   | 0.378
| 12 base | 354M | 870M   | 0.407
| 12 full | 669M | 1685M  | 0.397
|==========

The ratios are all within 10% of 0.41.  I'd suggest using a safety margin
of 10 Meg + 10% but even this might not suffice if, for example, a lot of
compressed media files or large amounts of pseudo-random data are stored.
For those cases the compression ratio will be close to 1.0 and might even
exceed 1.0 due to overhead.

You can get an accurate measure of home much space the uncompressed file system
takes up with the +du+ command applied to the AUFS mount point:

--------------------
# du -sm /aufs | cut -f1
892
--------------------
This says the file system takes up 892 Meg.  The estimate for the linuxfs
file would be 892 * .45 + 10 = 407 Meg.

It should be much faster to just look at the size of what is used in the RAM
part of the AUFS and then add this to the size of the existing linuxfs file:

--------------------
# du -sm /aufs-ram | cut -f1
23
# du -sm /boot-dev/antiX-12/linuxfs | cut -f1
354
--------------------

This is faster and it is also provides a more conservative estimate.  For
example, if the user has deleted a bunch of packages then the size of the
new linuxfs file will be smaller than the size of the orignal but this
estimate will always say the new linuxfs file will be larger than the
original.

In the example above the RAM part of the AUFS file system takes up 23 Meg and
the original linuxfs file takes 354 Meg.  The estimate for the size of the
new linuxfs file is 354 + 23 * .45 + 10 = 374.  This is smaller than the
previous estimate because of the safety margins.  If you remove those then the
two estimates agree with within 1%.
